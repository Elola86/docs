# Provisioning Flows

## Standard Provisioning - DMS

DMS stands for **Device Manufacturing System** and stands at the core of Lamassu. It is the central piece that tides CAs with your devices in an **automatized** and **standardized** manner.

Instead of having to create your own integrations between Lamassu and your devices, a DMS provides a set of endpoints that should be invoked by a device.
